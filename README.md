# Network_Anamoly_Detection

In this project, we focused on intrusion detection using the NSL-KDD dataset and proposed a novel approach employing an autoencoder-based architecture for feature extraction and anomaly detection. The dataset, comprising 41 attributes, including one class attribute, was pre-processed through one-hot encoding, column removal, target variable encoding, and data normalization. Our experimental results showcased the effectiveness of different models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Naive Bayes. Notably, KNN and Random Forest exhibited exceptional accuracy. The autoencoder's unique ability to capture intrinsic patterns within the data contributed to the overall success of our proposed model. It's important to note that this project is an ongoing effort, and we continue to refine and enhance our methodology. These findings, along with detailed methodologies, are shared to contribute to the wider community's understanding of intrusion detection techniques, and we are actively working on further improvements.
